This a Python script that post-processes existing G-Code to add gradient infill for 3D prints.

Watch my YouTube video about it: https://youtu.be/hq53gsYREHU

# Important Notes

In its current for it only works with G-Code files generated with CURA due to the comments CURA puts into the G-Code files.

It is also important to make sure that the "Walls" are printed before the "Infill" ("Infill before Walls" OFF).
For this script to work, also activate "Relative Extrusion" under "Special Modes".

# GradientInfill.py

GradientInfill.py Posprocessing Script for Cura PlugIn. 

Save the file in the _C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura **X.X**\plugins\PostProcessingPlugin\scripts_ directory

![PlugIn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11015345/72688053-110a0a00-3b04-11ea-8725-f602c0e98951.jpg)

Extrusion mode in Cura must be set in relative mode. If it's not the case an error message will be raised in Cura.

No Gcode will be generated by Cura in this case.

Infill pattern type ZigZag and Concentric not allowed  as well as the option "Connect Infill Lines" for the other patterns.

Add new Flow Value for short distance (Linear move < 2 x Gradient distance)
